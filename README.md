# Development Notes

## Mission:

Rebuild the app foundation. 

## Background:
When I first started the app it had been long since I build anything from scratch. However, I wanted to put together a QUICK proof of concept to see if it was an idea I wanted to pursuing. The result was a functional app and a new found love for development. The original client is built with jQuery and d3.js. I also pulled the weather data with the metaweather api and got retrieved user authentication through googleMaps api. 

## Short Term goals 
-Establish file system 
-install Jade
-install angular
-(Code Review) Server update

## Long Term Goals
-setup app.js
-settle on app views(photoshop?)
-implement caching and local storage to deal with making too many api calls to googleMaps
-Implement local storage in general
-implement stylesheets
