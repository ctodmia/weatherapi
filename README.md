# Development Notes

## Mission

Rebuild the app foundation. Refresh server.js, implement

## Short Term goals 
- Establish file system 
- install Jade
- install angular
- (Code Review) Server update
- install angular material design 


## Long Term Goals
- setup app.js
- settle on app views(photoshop?)
- implement caching and local storage to deal with making too many api calls to googleMaps
- Implement local storage in general
- implement stylesheets
- install build tools

## Thoughts 
When I first started the app it had been long since I build anything from scratch. However, I wanted to put together a QUICK proof of concept to see if it was an idea I wanted to pursuing. The result was a functional app and a new found love for development. The original client is built with jQuery and d3.js. I also pulled the weather data with the metaweather api and got retrieved user authentication through googleMaps api. Although I loved working with googleMaps and the metaweather api, I hated working with jQuery and d3.js. I wanted to explore d3 so but the last time I used it I was working with jQuery and hadn't heard good things about mixing d3 with angularjs(my preferred framework) 
I also want to get better about writing documentation for my code for the sake of my profession and the open source community.
